# Contribution guidelines

Following the contribution guidelines helps both owners and contributors. The guidelines save time and hassle caused by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.

## When to use issues

We prefer to use issues for reporting real 'issues' or bugs. For feature requests you can visit the feature request section of Discussion and start a new thread there.


## Pull requests (PR)

Please ensure that you have filled answers to as many questions as applicable while creating a PR.
